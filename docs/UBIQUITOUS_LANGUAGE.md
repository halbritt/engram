# Ubiquitous Language

## Bounded contexts

Engram product language splits into six contexts. Project coordination is a
separate process context; do not mix its terms into product architecture unless
they become binding decisions.

| Context | Owns |
|---------|------|
| **Ingest** | Source-specific parsers (chatgpt, claude, gemini, obsidian, mcp capture) → raw_evidence rows |
| **Corpus** | Raw evidence (immutable), segments, claims, beliefs, embeddings, entities |
| **Retrieval** | `context_for` compiler, candidate lanes, ranking, snapshots, MCP serving |
| **Eval** | Gold set, smoke / tier-2 / full-corpus tiers, `context_feedback`, adversarial sweeps |
| **Supervisor** | Pipeline orchestration, resumability, progress/error accounting, generation activation gates |
| **Lifecycle** | Privacy tiers, posthumous handoff, prompt/model versioning, re-derivation triggers |
| **Project coordination** | RFCs, reviews, synthesis, operational prompts, roadmap state, model handoffs |

The corpus-reading process has no network egress; the network-using
process has no direct corpus access. The wall is structural, not
disciplinary.

## Core distinctions (the ones that drift)

### Subject vs user vs consumer

- **Subject** — the one human whose biography this stores. Singular by design.
- **User** — colloquial alias for the subject when operating the system (CLI, review queue). Same person, different role.
- **Consumer** — a downstream model that *receives* `context_for` output. Frontier models, future local models, MCP clients. Consumers never touch the corpus directly.

Do not use "user" for consumers. The biography is *of* the user, *for* the consumers.

### Raw evidence vs `captures`

- **Raw evidence** — the collective term for the immutable layer: `sources`, `conversations`, `messages`, `notes`, `captures`. UPDATE/DELETE are blocked at trigger level.
- **`captures` (table)** — *one specific kind* of raw evidence: observations / tasks / ideas / references / person notes / user corrections / reclassifications.

A capture is evidence; not all evidence is a capture. Migration 001 is named `raw_evidence`; migration 002 reclassifies *within* it. When you mean the layer, say **raw evidence**. When you mean the table, say **captures**.

### Claim vs belief

- **Claim** — one LLM extraction from one segment, with `evidence_ids` to the raw rows that supported it. May contradict other claims; not yet adjudicated.
- **Belief** — a bitemporal, status-tracked, stability-classed assertion that survived consolidation. Has `valid_from` / `valid_to`, `confidence`, `stability_class`, `superseded_by` chain. `evidence_ids` is NOT NULL on `accepted`.
- **Current belief** — a belief with `valid_to IS NULL` (and `is_active` true per D027). Surfaced via the `current_beliefs` view.

Beliefs never derive from other beliefs. Both claims and beliefs trace back to raw evidence; that is the three-tier separation.

### Segment vs message vs conversation

- **Conversation** — one immutable row per source-side dialogue (one ChatGPT thread, etc.).
- **Message** — one immutable row per turn within a conversation. Has `role`, `sequence_index`. Raw turns are *not* embedded.
- **Segment** — a topic-coherent slice of contiguous messages, produced by LLM segmentation. The unit of embedding and the unit of claim extraction.

If something embeds a raw message directly, it's a bug — raw turns are out of the vector index by policy.

### Raw vs derived (the cache rule)

- **Raw** — the immutable layer. Source of truth. Storage is "everything forever."
- **Derived** / **cache** — segments, claims, beliefs, embeddings, entity_edges, snapshots, eval rows. Rebuildable from raw alone.

If a derivation cannot be reproduced from raw, it has become a second source of truth and the principle is broken.

### Belief supersession vs segment generation cutover

Two different non-destructive update mechanics. Don't conflate.

- **Belief supersession** (close-and-insert) — contradicting evidence closes the prior belief's `valid_to` and inserts a new row referenced by `superseded_by`. Bitemporal. Per-belief.
- **Segment generation cutover** (`is_active` flip) — re-segmenting under a new `segmenter_version` produces a *generation* of new rows; cutover flips `is_active` on segments and `segment_embeddings` only after required embeddings exist (D027 / D031). N-to-M, not 1:1.

Per D027, segment-level `superseded_by` was removed in favor of `is_active` precisely because segments don't supersede 1:1 across generations. Reach for `superseded_by` only on beliefs.

## Glossary by context

### Ingest

- **Source** — top-level `sources` row; one per ingested artifact (an export file, a Takeout zip, an MCP capture call). Discriminated by `source_kind`.
- **`source_kind`** — enum: `chatgpt | claude | gemini | obsidian | capture | future`. Not "platform," "vendor," "origin."
- **`external_id`** — the source-side identifier preserved verbatim; uniqueness with `source_id`.
- **`raw_payload`** — the original JSONB payload, untransformed. Always preserved; typed columns are optional projections of it.
- **Reclassification** — a `captures` row with `capture_type = 'reclassification'`, used to change a tier or category on prior rows without mutating them. See migration 002.

### Corpus

- **Supervisor** — Engram's pipeline coordinator for derived stages. In Phase 2
  this is the CLI/batcher path around `segment_pending`, `embed_pending_segments`,
  progress rows, and generation activation. It selects parents, invokes stage
  workers, records failures, keeps work resumable, and prevents partial
  retrieval visibility. Do not confuse this with systemd supervision of local
  services such as `ik-llama-server.service`.
- **Stage worker** — the implementation of one derivation step, such as the
  segmenter or embedder. A worker transforms selected inputs; the supervisor
  decides ordering, retry/progress accounting, and when downstream visibility is
  allowed.
- **Generation** — a versioned cohort of segments produced under one `segmenter_version`. Tracked in `segment_generations`. The unit of cutover; not the unit of retrieval.
- **`segment_embeddings`** (D027) — the retrieval-visible vector table. HNSW index lives here so it can push down on `is_active` and `privacy_tier`. Distinct from `embedding_cache`.
- **`embedding_cache`** — pure API cache; SHA256-keyed input + `embedding_model_version` + `embedding_dimension`. Re-running an unchanged model is free. No retrieval index lives here.
- **Embedding** — vector representation of a segment or accepted belief. Versioned by `embedding_model_version`. Storage is dimension-flexible per D033; ANN indexes are scoped per active model/dimension.
- **Bounded / windowed segmentation** (D029) — over-budget parents are split into deterministic overlapping windows. `window_strategy` records how, so re-derivation is reproducible. Resumable per intra-parent checkpoint.
- **`is_active`** — flag on `segments` and `segment_embeddings`. Marks the row as part of the currently retrieval-visible generation. Flipped at generation cutover, never updated piecemeal.
- **Active sequence uniqueness** (D030) — at most one active segment per `(parent, sequence_index)`. Enforced at the database boundary, not by LLM JSON discipline.
- **Stability class** — one of `identity | preference | project_status | goal | task | mood | relationship`. Drives currentness decay in ranking. Identity decays slowly; mood decays fast.
- **Belief audit** — `belief_audit` table; one row per state transition (candidate → provisional → accepted → superseded → rejected).

### Retrieval

- **`context_for(conversation)`** — the primary product surface. Given a conversation, returns a sectioned context package. Pure read; no network egress.
- **Lane** — one candidate stream feeding `context_for`. Lanes: semantic belief, semantic segment, keyword/BM25, recent activity, active projects, mentioned-entity neighborhood, pinned profile facts, open contradictions, missing-data detection.
- **Section** — a labeled chunk in rendered output (Standing Context, Active Projects, Relevant Beliefs, Recent Signals, Entity Context, Raw Evidence Snippets, Uncertain / Conflicting, Missing Data / Gaps). Each has an explicit token budget.
- **Snapshot** (`context_snapshots`) — a precomputed rendered context, served warm via MCP. Refreshed asynchronously after capture / review / feedback / belief change.
- **Warm read** — serving from a fresh snapshot. Default path.
- **Cold compile** — synchronous full `context_for` recomputation when no fresh snapshot exists. Fallback.

### Eval

- **Gold set** — the subject-authored prompts that define what good looks like. The *actual* specification per the eval-as-oracle principle. Authoring cannot be delegated.
- **Smoke tier** — eval over ~100 conversations. Catches catastrophic pipeline failures.
- **Gold-set validation** — eval authored after claims and beliefs exist, using
  reviewable claims/beliefs plus raw evidence as the memory aid. Expected facts
  come from the human's real-life answer, not from extracted outputs.
- **Full AI-conversation Phase 2 run** — segmentation + embedding over all
  ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini conversations. Excludes Obsidian notes, live
  captures, and other non-conversation sources.
- **Eval gate** — the policy that unbounded re-extraction / re-consolidation
  cycles should be driven by gold-set results once claims and beliefs exist.
- **`context_feedback`** — table; one row per `useful` / `wrong` / `stale` / `irrelevant` annotation on a `context_for` output. References the belief and segment ids that produced the offending section. Treated as evolving ground truth.
- **Adversarial sweep** / **falsification sweep** — periodic multi-model pass over high-confidence beliefs ("what raw evidence would contradict this — find it"). Substitutes for engagement signal in a single-user system.
- **Preflight probe** — a small, phase-specific empirical check run *before* implementation, to validate assumptions the prompt is making (e.g., effective context window, structured-output behavior, cache conflict semantics). Cheaper than eval; runs once per phase. Distinct from a disproof probe.
- **Disproof probe** — a falsification challenge attached to an adversarial review finding ("what would have to be true for this not to be a problem"). Lives in the review document, not in the implementation prompt.

### Lifecycle

- **Privacy tier** — integer column on raw rows and derived units. Tier 1 (only-me, only-this-machine) is the default; tiers 2–5 per HUMAN_REQUIREMENTS.md. Reclassification is a new capture row, not a column update.
- **As-recorded tier** vs **effective tier** — the as-recorded tier is what was written to the raw row at insert time. The effective tier is computed at read time as the as-recorded tier overridden by the most-recent reclassification capture targeting that row (D023). They are not the same value, and forms that surface tier should say which.
- **Privacy inheritance** (D032) — a segment's privacy tier is `max(parent conversation/note/capture tier, all constituent raw-row tiers)`. Not just the parent, not just the rows.
- **Parent scope** — the unit of reclassification invalidation per D032. Reclassifying one message invalidates derived rows for its parent conversation/note/capture only — not the whole source export.
- **Posthumous handoff** — encrypted dead-man's-switch. After confirmed inactivity, keys release to designated successors per the privacy-tier model. Tier-5 categories are cryptographically destroyed pre-release.
- **`prompt_version` / `model_version`** — required on every belief. Pin which extraction prompt and which model produced it; re-derivation must be auditable.
- **Request profile** (D034) — the deterministic local-LLM call contract for derived stages: pinned endpoint and model id, streaming and thinking disabled, deterministic sampling, JSON schema response format, parse only `choices[0].message.content` (not `reasoning_content`). Recorded in derivation version metadata so re-runs are reproducible.
- **Re-derivation trigger** — capability change, not calendar. Four canonical triggers: new embedding model, new extraction prompt/model, new segmentation heuristic, targeted slice upgrade.

### Project coordination

These terms describe how work moves through the repo. They are not product
architecture by themselves.

- **Project coordinator** — the human or agent managing work order, review
  loops, synthesis, prompt creation, and handoffs. Do not confuse this with the
  product **Supervisor**, which coordinates pipeline stages inside Engram.
- **Artifact** — a durable repo document or code change with provenance:
  RFC, decision, review, phase doc, operational prompt, implementation patch,
  benchmark result, or status note.
- **RFC** — a proposal parked under `docs/rfcs/`. Not binding until promoted
  into `DECISION_LOG.md`, `BUILD_PHASES.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, or an accepted
  execution prompt.
- **Decision** — a binding architecture choice recorded in `DECISION_LOG.md`.
  Current canonical IDs are `D###`.
- **Review artifact** — feedback written under `docs/reviews/`. Raw review
  findings live here first; reviewers do not patch the source artifact unless
  explicitly assigned to.
- **Synthesis** — the originating context's adjudication of review feedback:
  accepted, accepted with modification, deferred, or rejected. Accepted deltas
  update the source artifact; binding deltas update `DECISION_LOG.md`.
- **Operational prompt** — a file under `prompts/` used as an execution handoff
  for an agent. Distinct from `prompt_version`, which records an LLM extraction
  prompt used in the data pipeline.
- **Execution handoff** — a ready-to-run operational prompt with accepted
  decisions only, non-goals, traps, files in scope, test commands, and
  acceptance criteria.
- **Fresh execution context** — a new agent context started after synthesis for
  non-trivial implementation. Keeps rejected options and review debate out of
  the worker's attention.
- **Human attention queue** — the active set of ready or half-ready prompts and
  decisions the human would otherwise have to remember. Queue state belongs in
  filenames, prompt headers, `ROADMAP.md`, or phase docs.
- **Human checkpoint** — a decision boundary that should still involve the
  human: priority/taste calls, "good enough" calls, gold-set authorship, and
  any relaxation of local-first/privacy/egress constraints.

## Forbidden / corrected terms

| Don't say | Say instead | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| "memory" (as the noun for a unit) | belief / claim / segment / capture (be specific) | Collapses three-tier separation |
| "chunk" / "chunking" | segment / segmentation | Chunking implies fixed-size mechanical splits; segments are LLM-decided topic boundaries respecting message structure. The distinction is load-bearing for claim extraction grounding. D029's windowing is a fallback for over-budget *input*, not the shape of the *output*. |
| "fact" | belief (with confidence + validity) | Hides uncertainty and time |
| "user data" | raw evidence, or the specific table | Obscures the layer |
| "extract a memory" | extract a *claim*, then consolidate to a *belief* | Skips adjudication |
| "delete the bad belief" | supersede via new raw evidence | Beliefs are never destructively updated |
| "the model decides" | the extraction prompt at `prompt_version=X` produced | Pin which version did it |
| "the model defaults" (for local-LLM call shape) | the request profile at D034 specifies | D034 forbids relying on model defaults for derivation calls |
| segment "supersedes" prior segment | segment generation cutover via `is_active` | Segments don't supersede 1:1; D027 removed `superseded_by` from segments |
| "supervisor" for the human/agent managing repo work | project coordinator | Supervisor is an Engram pipeline role |
| "prompt" without context | operational prompt, extraction prompt, review prompt, or prompt_version | The project has multiple prompt types with different lifecycles |
| "run the RFC" | create an operational prompt from the accepted RFC | RFCs are proposals, not execution handoffs |
| "review feedback" in chat only | review artifact under `docs/reviews/` | Feedback should not live in volatile human memory |
| "send this to the cloud" | (rejected — local-first) | Refusal, not phrasing |
| "engram queries the web" | (rejected — corpus/network separation) | Same |

## Open terminology questions

Decisions still owed:

1. **"Episode"** — used in HUMAN_REQUIREMENTS.md and V1_ARCHITECTURE_DRAFT.md ("raw episode / message / note / capture id") but no `episodes` table exists. Alias for one of {conversation, message, segment}, or a deferred primitive? Pin or remove.
2. **"Hot state" vs "snapshot"** — used interchangeably in the 2026-04-29 delta. If they're the same, pick one. If hot state is broader (KV-cache prefix + snapshot + memory_events), say so.
3. **"Subject"** — the schema has `subject_entity_id` on beliefs. Is *the* subject (the person) the same concept as a *belief subject* (any entity), or are these distinct levels that happen to share a word?
4. **"Pinned"** — appears in "pinned facts," "pinned profile facts," and "promote-to-pinned" (review queue). Define the table-level mechanic.
5. **"Active"** — partially resolved. `is_active` on `segments` and `segment_embeddings` is now the canonical flag for "part of the current generation" (D027 / D031). "Active goals/projects" remains a colloquial use in the `context_for` lane vocabulary. If a third use creeps in (e.g., on captures), pin distinct names then.
6. **Generation** — used informally in the synthesis ("segment generation," "belief generation") but only `segment_generations` is a real table. Decide whether "belief generation" stays metaphorical or becomes a primitive.
7. **`reasoning_content` vs `content`** — D034 says parse `content` only, but a glossary entry on the assistant-message shape (and *why* `reasoning_content` exists) would help future implementers not silently drift back to it.
