# Operator Report

Last updated: 2026-05-13

## Current State

- Repo: `/home/halbritt/git/engram`
- Branch: `master`
- Current objective: recover and promote the RFC 0028/RFC 0029 work through legitimate review, rerun Phase 4 gate review with multi-lane evidence, audit older Striatum provenance gaps, and then scaffold/execute the backlog with maximum useful parallelism.
- Current checkpoint: RFC 0032 recovery implementation is committed as `4c59259` (`Recover RFC 0032 audit findings`).
- Sync status: fetched and rebased against `origin/master`; branch was already up to date.
- Current uncommitted batch: changelog audit repairs, pre-suspect quarantine notices, and fresh Striatum rerun scaffolds.

## Verified Work

- `make migrate` passed after adding migration `013_interview_active_learning_state.sql`.
- `make schema-docs` regenerated `docs/schema/README.md`.
- Focused touched-area tests passed: 190 tests.
- Full suite passed: `505 passed in 227.47s`.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Completed In Current Checkpoint

- Quarantined suspect RFC 0028/RFC 0029 review artifacts and Striatum workflow scaffolds.
- Demoted unauthorized RFC 0028/RFC 0029 promotion claims and removed the unauthorized decision row.
- Removed stale root-level Striatum guide exports.
- Repaired bench-review host trust and CLI exception handling.
- Implemented Phase 3 interview active-learning/session-target persistence and resume/history behavior.
- Hardened interview web reachability and rationale validation.
- Added Phase 4 preflight/current-belief refresh behavior.
- Refreshed user docs, RFC index, schema docs, and changelog entries touched by this recovery.

## Active Plan

1. Audit `CHANGELOG.md` against git history, RFC statuses, and decision log.
   - Done for the first pass; unreleased/current-state and Phase 1/2 historical corrections are applied in the worktree.
2. Create a GitHub issue in `~/git/striatum` for lane-output provenance hardening.
   - Done: https://github.com/halbritt/striatum/issues/5
3. Keep fetching/rebasing onto `origin/master` between batches.
4. Keep `OPERATOR_REPORT.md` current before long workflow runs and compaction risk.
5. Audit pre-suspect Striatum runs for RFC 0021/RFC 0027 provenance gaps.
   - Done for the first pass: RFC 0021/RFC 0027 review bylines are unattested by `process_executions`; quarantine notices are applied.
6. Re-scaffold and rerun legitimate multi-lane reviews for RFC 0028, RFC 0029, and Phase 4 gate evidence.
   - Fresh validated scaffolds exist for RFC 0021 rerun, RFC 0027 rerun, RFC 0028 promotion, RFC 0029 design/spec/implementation, and Phase 4 multi-lane gate.
7. Synthesize review outcomes, promote accepted artifacts, and update `DECISION_LOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and docs.
8. Scaffold backlog workflows and drive independent implementation lanes in parallel.

## Completed Parallel Audits

- Changelog accuracy audit.
- Pre-suspect RFC 0021/RFC 0027 Striatum provenance audit.
- Striatum rerun command/scaffold audit for RFC 0028, RFC 0029, and Phase 4.
- Phase 4 multi-lane gate evidence audit.
- Backlog dependency and first-wave workflow audit.

## Validated Fresh Workflows

- `striatum/rfc-0021-gold-set-review-rerun-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/rfc-0027-interview-web-ui-review-rerun-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/rfc-0028-predicate-intent-promotion-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/rfc-0029-bench-triage-workbench-design-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/rfc-0029-bench-triage-workbench-spec-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/rfc-0029-bench-triage-workbench-implementation-2026-05-13/workflow.json`
- `striatum/phase-4-tiered-gate-multilane-2026-05-13/workflow.json`

## Execution Constraints

- Do not run all seven workflows concurrently in the same worktree. Use separate git worktrees for workflow-level parallelism.
- RFC 0029 design precedes RFC 0029 spec, which precedes RFC 0029 implementation.
- RFC 0028 promotion and RFC 0029 implementation both touch overlapping code surfaces; avoid concurrent writes in one worktree.
- Phase 4 evidence collection is serial through Tier 0-2, then fans out to independent reviews.
- Backlog first wave can run in parallel as design/planning work: RFC 0030 design, RFC 0022 design, RFC 0018 Stage 1/2 planning, RFC 0023 validation planning, and RFC 0012/0015 focused quality follow-ups.

## Open Risks

- The repo is currently on `master`; `origin/master` is the remote default branch.
- RFC 0028/RFC 0029 can only be promoted again after fresh legitimate review or explicit operator decision.
- Phase 4 gate status remains a decision item until multi-lane review evidence or explicit operator acceptance lands.
- Older Striatum runs may need quarantine or rerun if their provenance cannot be verified.
- The local Striatum CLI reports `striatum 1.36.0` from the editable checkout. The Striatum worktree has pre-existing dirty files; this Engram pass has not modified them.
