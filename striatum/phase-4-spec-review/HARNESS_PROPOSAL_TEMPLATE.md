# HARNESS-NNN — short title

Status: proposed
Run: phase-4-spec-review
Reporter: {role}-{model}-{ordinal}
Surface: {prompt | workflow | spec | defaults | documentation}

## Observed friction

What happened? Include the command, work packet, source, or prompt
that made the friction visible. For phase-4 spec review specifically,
flag friction in:

- the three reviewer prompts (`prompts/review.md`, prompt clarity);
- the ledger normalization rules (severity thresholds, merge
  heuristics);
- the synthesis decision shape (the four numbered outcomes);
- the `review_revision_policy: human_checkpoint` blocking pattern
  vs. an alternative;
- workflow JSON shape, lane commands, harness profiles.

## Supporting runner evidence

- run_id:
- job_id:
- packet_id:
- supervisor_id:
- relevant event types from `striatum why <id>`:

## Proposed change

What should change in the runner, workflow contract, prompts,
defaults, tool profile fixture, spec, or docs? Keep the
front-matter `target` value inside the schema's allowed set:
`prompt`, `workflow`, `spec`, `defaults`, or `documentation`.

## Risk

What gets worse if this change ships?

## Rollback

If the change is wrong, how do we unwind it?

## Notes

Anything else worth preserving before context fades.
